Q1.  How long did you spend working on this project?
  A1.  About 4 hours, I believe.


Q2.  What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  A2.  After I figured out how to correctly utilize the in_stock method and the @@in_stock class variable array (is that a real term?), it was so rewarding because I just kicked into gear and sailed smoothly through the rest of the project.


Q3.  What two additional features did you build? Why?
  A3(a). Giving the customer the ability to return an ite, because this isn't Caveat Emptor Capitalism!
  A3(b). Listing the purchases (and their ID's and titles), how else are you going to return things without a real receipt? 

Q4.  Where do you still have room to grow?
  A4.  I need to work on my eloquence a bit more. And my sloppy typing; I made a lot of stupid typing errors throughout this project, it took me a while to figure out why my 'initalize' method wasn't working!
